      <h2 id="intro">Digitisation, selection, and cultural power</h2>
      <p>
        Discussions around GLAM digitisation initially appeared to me as largely technical matters with scanning fragile
        artefacts, producing stable file formats, and sustaining workflows. The early course materials seemed to confirm this
        view, with their emphasis on standards, primary digitisation, and infrastructures such as Europeana. But as the module
        unfolded, and especially as the examples from Tallinn, Rijeka, the Thessaloniki pilot, and the Tate and Pompidou came
        into view, that neat picture began to unravel. I started to see that digitisation is not simply a neutral upgrade. It
        is a cultural and political act that shapes what becomes visible, what survives, and what quietly slips out of
        circulation. It does not merely expand access; it also sets the terms on which culture will exist in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key realisation for me was that digitisation is unavoidably selective, and therefore a form of power. To digitise an
        artefact is, in a sense, to grant it an afterlife and make it searchable, linkable, and eligible for circulation
        across platforms and aggregators. Europeana demonstrates how this selective logic now operates on a continental scale
        by connecting tens of millions of objects across thousands of institutions. Material that remains undigitised, by
        contrast, faces disappearance in both physical and digital cultural domains. Expanded digital access can mask profound
        unevenness, leaving minority cultures and local archives underrepresented despite the rhetoric of openness (King,
        Stark &amp; Cooke, 2016). Limited institutional resources further amplify this imbalance, favouring dominant languages
        and heavily documented collections. Digitisation is therefore not passive preservation. Instead, it actively reshapes
        cultural hierarchies by determining what is discoverable, searchable, and re-usable.
      </p>

      <h2 id="platforms-ai">Platforms, AI, and algorithmic gatekeeping</h2>
      <p>
        The discussions in Tallinn made this asymmetry feel even sharper. In a cultural landscape now mediated by search
        engines, social media feeds, aggregators and AI systems, platforms have become de facto gatekeepers. Algorithms
        decide what is recommended or included in training datasets, often reproducing existing structural inequalities rather
        than alleviating them (Noble, 2014). Material that is undigitised, or poorly described, effectively does not exist in
        algorithmic terms. Both Tallinn and the Council of Europe’s seminar in Rijeka warned that without equitable
        digitisation and interoperable infrastructures, digital culture risks reinforcing these hierarchies. The Council of
        Europe’s Recommendation on Big Data for Culture, Literacy and Democracy (2017) underscores this danger by articulating
        a right to remain “inscrutable”, a right to resist continuous profiling and prediction. It reframes cultural
        participation not as a personalised optimisation challenge but as a democratic right.
      </p>

      <h2 id="open-glam">Open GLAM and cultural infrastructures</h2>
      <p>
        Seen in this light, the urgency of Open GLAM becomes clearer. Open standards, open metadata and open-access
        infrastructures are not simply technical preferences, instead they function as counterweights to platform-driven
        inequalities. Digitisation must be accompanied by policies that safeguard diversity and citizen agency in an
        AI-mediated environment, as noted by the Council of Europe (n.d.). The Tate and Pompidou case studies show how open
        institutional infrastructures can broaden public participation and reduce reliance on opaque commercial systems
        (Alshawaaf &amp; Lee, 2020). These examples suggest that open frameworks are not auxiliary enhancements. They are the
        foundations on which cultural visibility and public cultural participation depend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Council of Europe’s insistence on inscrutability also unsettles the assumption that cultural experiences must be
        endlessly personalised. Cultural meaning thrives on unpredictability: on serendipity, discomfort, and discovery. These
        are the qualities predictive analytics struggle to reproduce. Fully personalised systems risk constructing cultural
        echo chambers and narrowing the aesthetic field. A world filtered entirely through algorithmic similarity would be
        culturally homogeneous and intellectually stagnant.
      </p>

      <h2 id="policy">Policy, unpredictability, and cultural democracy</h2>
      <p>
        Seen together, these debates shift the policy implications. If digital platforms increasingly mediate access to
        culture, GLAM institutions must consider how to safeguard unpredictability and plurality within algorithmic ecosystems.
        Should recommendation systems be designed to include moments of “surprise”? Should digitisation priorities foreground
        endangered or underrepresented cultures to counterbalance algorithmic bias? Should funding shift toward infrastructures
        that guarantee digital discoverability rather than prioritising traditional exhibition practices? These are not
        technical adjustments, but political decisions about cultural democracy. They are also about whether digitisation
        expands cultural agency or, perhaps just as easily, restricts it, and whether Open GLAM can realistically
        counterbalance platform power.
      </p>

      <h2 id="artistic-practice">Artistic practice and infrastructural critique</h2>
      <p>
        The course also changed how I think about art in an AI-saturated environment. I began to see how artistic practice can
        function as a critical method for making technological infrastructures visible. <em>Anatomy of an AI System</em>,
        created by Crawford and Joler, was particularly striking to me: it maps the labour, extraction and data flows
        underlying the Amazon Echo (Crawford &amp; Joler, 2018). Its presentation at the Council of Europe’s expert seminar in
        Rijeka shows how artistic interpretation is now recognised in policy spaces as a legitimate way of exposing the
        political and material realities of AI systems (Council of Europe, 2018). A similar sensibility appeared in the
        Thessaloniki pilot: the 3D reconstructions weren’t aimed at producing seamless virtual pasts but at foregrounding the
        modelling assumptions, uncertainties and interpretative decisions behind them (Valeonti, 2022). Rather than offering
        polished replicas, the project highlighted the epistemic labour behind them, showing how artistic and curatorial
        choices shape what can be culturally imagined in digital form.
      </p>

      <h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks for interpretive transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Both the London Charter and the Seville Principles reinforce this orientation by requiring digital heritage
        visualisations to make their interpretive foundations visible. The London Charter emphasises “intellectual
        transparency” where users should be able to distinguish evidence from hypothesis and understand varying degrees of
        probability, supported by documentation of research sources and interpretative decisions (London Charter, 2009). The
        Seville Principles likewise stress authenticity and scientific transparency, requiring virtual reconstructions to
        differentiate clearly between in situ material, physical reconstruction and purely virtual restoration
        (López-Menchero &amp; Grande, 2013). Together, these frameworks insist that digitisation involves choices: what to
        emphasise or leave out, which narratives to foreground, and even how much uncertainty to expose. They also challenge
        the myth of technological neutrality by asking digital models to expose, rather than hide, their interpretive layers.
      </p>

      <h2 id="commercial-platforms">Commercial platforms and cultural activation events</h2>
      <p>
        Still, even the best frameworks cannot ensure impact if public cultural habits do not shift. This becomes most
        visible when considering commercial platforms. Commercialisation is often framed as a threat to cultural integrity,
        but the course encouraged me to see it instead as a condition shaped by everyday digital behaviours. Governments may
        build policy infrastructures, and GLAM institutions may create interoperable collections, but private platforms supply
        the technological capacity and distribution pathways through which most people now encounter culture. A sustainable
        digital cultural ecosystem ultimately depends not only on institutions but on how publics choose to engage with the
        heritage available to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This realisation led me to what I call cultural activation events—moments when cultural materials abruptly gain
        visibility through digital circulation. These events do not replace long-term institutional planning, but they can
        spark attention and generate momentum. They include, for instance, a museum TikTok trend introducing an artefact to
        younger audiences, a digitised manuscript that becomes a meme, or an online exhibition that unexpectedly goes viral.
        Such phenomena reveal that cultural participation today is not linear or exclusively institutional; it is hybrid,
        algorithmic, and socially distributed across many digital spaces.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: digitisation as cultural responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        From this perspective, digitisation becomes not only a preservation tool but also a way of imagining cultural futures.
        It determines what survives, how it circulates, and who can take part in shaping cultural meaning. AI compels us to
        defend unpredictability, diversity and multiplicity within cultural systems. Platformisation forces us to rethink how
        access is organised beyond institutional walls. Commercial dynamics, meanwhile, raise new questions about what
        meaningful participation even looks like. GLAM institutions, situated at the intersection of policy, technology and
        public behaviour, must navigate these pressures while upholding democratic responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        My own work during the course such as creating digital artefacts, building websites and taking part in collaborative
        discussions really reinforced this perspective for me. Digital practice, I realised, is not merely technical; it is as
        well interpretative and ethical. Every design decision, from interface layout to metadata structure, subtly shapes how
        audiences encounter and remember cultural materials. Even small interventions become part of a broader process of
        deciding which cultural forms will remain visible, valued or forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        If digitisation is the mechanism through which culture enters the future, then the future is already being shaped,
        through curatorial choices, platform behaviours, institutional policies and everyday user interactions. Thus for me,
        this means that digitisation is no longer a neutral procedure but a cultural responsibility. As digital humanists, our
        task is not simply to build systems but to cultivate environments that honour pluralism, transparency and public
        agency. Culture does not preserve itself; it is preserved, transformed and reimagined through the collective decisions
        we make now.
